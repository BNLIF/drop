# Config Files

## DAQ Setting
- `batch_size`: int. batch_size specifies the number of events to process in one batch. Load and process one batch at a time. The bigger the batch, the more the memory needed.
- `post_trigger`: float. Fraction of acquisition after trigger.
- `daisy_chain`: bool. True if digitizer trigger are in daisy chain.
- `dgtz_dynamic_range_mV`: int. Two acceptable options for V1730s: 2000 or 500.
- `non_signal_channels`: list of str, or list of int. Non-signal channels are also called auxiliary channel in code. For example, muon paddles are not considered signal, but digitized to provide supplementary info. Need to know auxiliary channels to reconstruction them separately.
- `bottom_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. List of channels for bottom PMTs.
- `side_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. List of channels for side PMTs.
- `row1_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. Top row of side PMTs.
- `row2_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. Second row from the top of side PMTs.
- `row3_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. Sixth row from the top of side PMTs.
- `row4_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. Seventh row from the top of side PMTs.
- `row5_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. Third row from the top of side PMTs. Added in second batch of installed PMTs.
- `row6_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. Fourth row from the top of side PMTs. Added in second batch of installed PMTs
- `row7_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. Fifth row from the top of side PMTs. Added in second batch of installed PMTs
- `col1_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. All b1_p* side pmts.
- `col2_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. All b2_p* side pmts.
- `col3_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. All b3_p* side pmts.
- `col4_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. All b4_p* side pmts.
- `col5_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. All b5_p* side pmts. Added in second batch of installed PMTs.
- `col6_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. All b6_p* side pmts. Added in second batch of installed PMTs.
- `col7_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. All b7_p* side pmts. Added in second batch of installed PMTs.
- `col8_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. All b8_p* side pmts. Added in second batch of installed PMTs.
- `user_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. User-defined list of channel to sum.
- `skip_pmt_channels`: list of str, or list of int. Channels in this list will be neglected in sum channel calculation. Usually empty. But sometimes we want to skip bad PMTs (gain instability etc).  
- `ch_saturated_threshold`: int. Threshold below which a channel is considered saturated. Unit: ADC.

## Calibration info
- `spe_fit_results_file`: str. SPE calibration are saved to a csv file. Specify the absolute path to the file. All PMT calibration results are saved in CERNBOX under `WbLS-DATA/db/spe`.
- `interpolate_spe`: bool. If `False`, use calibrated PMT info specified by `spe_fit_results_file` to do the spe normalization. If `True`, DROP will use the directory specified by `spe_fit_results_file` and automatically search for the two most recent led calibration results by datetime (one before and one after) in it. It will then do a linear interpolation between the two calibration results. The subdirectory `b/` just tracks PMT SPE fitting algorithm (ex. suppose one day we decide to use more sophisticated algorithm than simple Gaussian fit, we will create a new subdirectory for new calibration results). **Note: Be careful when HV is adjusted. You must take two consecutive LED runs, one with the original HV, and another with new HV value**

## Event Reconstruction Config

### Noise Filter
- `apply_high_pass_filter`: bool. Apply high pass filter or not. Do not recommend.
- `high_pass_cutoff_Hz`: float, high pass filter threshold
- `rolling_length`: int. rolling baseline window. **THIS IS NOT USED FOR NOW**
- `sigma_above_baseline`: float. sigma above threshold in rolling baseline. **THIS IS NOT USED FOR NOW**
- `pre_pulse`: int. Number of samples after pulse peak. **THIS IS NOT USED FOR NOW**
- `post_pulse`: int. Number of samples before pulse peak. **THIS IS NOT USED FOR NOW**

### ROI Assocaited
- `roi_start_ns`: list. ROI start time in ns. `roi_start_ns` is defined with respect to the trigger arrival time of the master boards. If roi_start_ns is eariler than the first sample,the first sample is used.
- `roi_end_ns`: list. ROI end time in ns. `roi_end_ns` is defined with respect to the trigger arrival time of the master boards. If roi_end_ns is bigger than DAQ length, the last sample is used.

> **Note**: The RQWriter will saves three ROI. For example, `roi_start_ns: [-200, -50, 200]` and `roi_end_ns: [-100, 50, 300]` define three 100ns ROIs. The first starts 200 ns before master trigger time. (MTT) The second start 50ns before and ends 50ns after MTT. The third starts 200 ns after MTT.

### scipy peak finding
- `pulse_finder_algo`: int. Options to chooose pulse finding algorthim. 0 is scipy peak finder
- `scipy_peak_finder_parameters`:
  - `distance`: float. Required minimal horizontal distance (>= 1) in samples between neighbouring peaks. Smaller peaks are removed first until the condition is fulfilled for all remaining peaks.
	- `threshold`: float. Required threshold of peaks, the vertical distance to its neighboring samples. Either a number, None, an array matching x or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first element is always interpreted as the minimal and the second, if supplied, as the maximal required threshold.
  	- `height` float. Required height of peaks. Either a number, None, an array matching x or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first element is always interpreted as the minimal and the second, if supplied, as the maximal required height.
    - `prominence`: float. The prominence of a peak may be defined as the least drop in height necessary in order to get from the summit to any higher terrain.
- `spe_height_threshold`: float. if a pulse-channel height is above this threshold, it's counted toward coincidence
