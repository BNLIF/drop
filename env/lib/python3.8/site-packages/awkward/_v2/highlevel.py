    Args:
        data (#ak.layout.Content, #ak.Array, `np.ndarray`, `cp.ndarray`, `pyarrow.*`, str, dict, or iterable):
            Data to wrap or convert into an array.
               - If a NumPy array, the regularity of its dimensions is preserved
                 and the data are viewed, not copied.
               - CuPy arrays are treated the same way as NumPy arrays except that
                 they default to `kernels="cuda"`, rather than `kernels="cpu"`.
               - If a pyarrow object, calls #ak.from_arrow, preserving as much
                 metadata as possible, usually zero-copy.
               - If a dict of str \u2192 columns, combines the columns into an
                 array of records (like Pandas's DataFrame constructor).
               - If a string, the data are assumed to be JSON.
               - If an iterable, calls #ak.from_iter, which assumes all dimensions
                 have irregular lengths.
        behavior (None or dict): Custom #ak.behavior for this Array only.
        with_name (None or str): Gives tuples and records a name that can be
            used to override their behavior (see below).
        check_valid (bool): If True, verify that the #layout is valid.
        kernels (None, `"cpu"`, or `"cuda"`): If `"cpu"`, the Array will be placed in
            main memory for use with other `"cpu"` Arrays and Records; if `"cuda"`,
            the Array will be placed in GPU global memory using CUDA; if None,
            the `data` are left untouched. For `"cuda"`,
            [awkward-cuda-kernels](https://pypi.org/project/awkward-cuda-kernels)
            must be installed, which can be invoked with
            `pip install awkward[cuda] --upgrade`.

    High-level array that can contain data of any type.

    For most users, this is the only class in Awkward Array that matters: it
    is the entry point for data analysis with an emphasis on usability. It
    intentionally has a minimum of methods, preferring standalone functions
    like

        ak.num(array1)
        ak.combinations(array1)
        ak.cartesian([array1, array2])
        ak.zip({"x": array1, "y": array2, "z": array3})

    instead of bound methods like

        array1.num()
        array1.combinations()
        array1.cartesian([array2, array3])
        array1.zip(...)   # ?

    because its namespace is valuable for domain-specific parameters and
    functionality. For example, if records contain a field named `"num"`,
    they can be accessed as

        array1.num

    instead of

        array1["num"]

    without any confusion or interference from #ak.num. The same is true
    for domain-specific methods that have been attached to the data. For
    instance, an analysis of mailing addresses might have a function that
    computes zip codes, which can be attached to the data with a method
    like

        latlon.zip()

    without any confusion or interference from #ak.zip. Custom methods like
    this can be added with #ak.behavior, and so the namespace of Array
    attributes must be kept clear for such applications.

    See also #ak.Record.

    Interfaces to other libraries
    =============================

    NumPy
    *****

    When NumPy
    [universal functions](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html)
    (ufuncs) are applied to an ak.Array, they are passed through the Awkward
    data structure, applied to the numerical data at its leaves, and the output
    maintains the original structure.

    For example,

        >>> array = ak.Array([[1, 4, 9], [], [16, 25]])
        >>> np.sqrt(array)
        <Array [[1, 2, 3], [], [4, 5]] type='3 * var * float64'>

    See also #ak.Array.__array_ufunc__.

    Some NumPy functions other than ufuncs are also handled properly in
    NumPy >= 1.17 (see
    [NEP 18](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html))
    and if an Awkward override exists. That is,

        np.concatenate

    can be used on an Awkward Array because

        ak.concatenate

    exists. If your NumPy is older than 1.17, use `ak.concatenate` directly.

    Pandas
    ******

    Ragged arrays (list type) can be converted into Pandas
    [MultiIndex](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html)
    rows and nested records can be converted into MultiIndex columns. If the
    Awkward Array has only one "branch" of nested lists (i.e. different record
    fields do not have different-length lists, but a single chain of lists-of-lists
    is okay), then it can be losslessly converted into a single DataFrame.
    Otherwise, multiple DataFrames are needed, though they can be merged (with a
    loss of information).

    The #ak.to_pandas function performs this conversion; if `how=None`, it
    returns a list of DataFrames; otherwise, `how` is passed to `pd.merge` when
    merging the resultant DataFrames.

    Numba
    *****

    Arrays can be used in [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/): they can be
    passed as arguments to a Numba-compiled function or returned as return
    values. The only limitation is that Awkward Arrays cannot be *created*
    inside the Numba-compiled function; to make outputs, consider
    #ak.ArrayBuilder.

    Arrow
    *****

    Arrays are convertible to and from [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/),
    a standard for representing nested data structures in columnar arrays.
    See #ak.to_arrow and #ak.from_arrow.

    NumExpr
    *******

    [NumExpr](https://numexpr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html) can
    calculate expressions on a set of ak.Arrays, but only if the functions in
    `ak.numexpr` are used, not the functions in the `numexpr` library directly.

    Like NumPy ufuncs, the expression is evaluated on the numeric leaves of the
    data structure, maintaining structure in the output.

    See #ak.numexpr.evaluate to calculate an expression.

    See #ak.numexpr.re_evaluate to recalculate an expression without
    rebuilding its virtual machine.

    Autograd
    ********

    Derivatives of a calculation on a set of ak.Arrays can be calculated with
    [Autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd#readme), but only if the
    function in `ak.autograd` is used, not the functions in the `autograd`
    library directly.

    Like NumPy ufuncs, the function and its derivatives are evaluated on the
    numeric leaves of the data structure, maintaining structure in the output.

    See #ak.autograd.elementwise_grad to calculate a function and its
    derivatives elementwise on each numeric value in an ak.Array.

        Args:
            where (many types supported; see below): Index of positions to
                select from this Array.

        Select items from the Array using an extension of NumPy's (already
        quite extensive) rules.

        All methods of selecting items described in
        [NumPy indexing](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.indexing.html)
        are supported with one exception
        ([combining advanced and basic indexing](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.indexing.html#combining-advanced-and-basic-indexing)
        with basic indexes *between* two advanced indexes: the definition
        NumPy chose for the result does not have a generalization beyond
        rectilinear arrays).

        The `where` parameter can be any of the following or a tuple of
        the following.

           * **An integer** selects one element. Like Python/NumPy, it is
             zero-indexed: `0` is the first item, `1` is the second, etc.
             Negative indexes count from the end of the list: `-1` is the
             last, `-2` is the second-to-last, etc.
             Indexes beyond the size of the array, either because they're too
             large or because they're too negative, raise errors. In
             particular, some nested lists might contain a desired element
             while others don't; this would raise an error.
           * **A slice** (either a Python `slice` object or the
             `start:stop:step` syntax) selects a range of elements. The
             `start` and `stop` values are zero-indexed; `start` is inclusive
             and `stop` is exclusive, like Python/NumPy. Negative `step`
             values are allowed, but a `step` of `0` is an error. Slices
             beyond the size of the array are not errors but are truncated,
             like Python/NumPy.
           * **A string** selects a tuple or record field, even if its
             position in the tuple is to the left of the dimension where the
             tuple/record is defined. (See <<projection>> below.) This is
             similar to NumPy's
             [field access](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.indexing.html#field-access),
             except that strings are allowed in the same tuple with other
             slice types. While record fields have names, tuple fields are
             integer strings, such as `"0"`, `"1"`, `"2"` (always
             non-negative). Be careful to distinguish these from non-string
             integers.
           * **An iterable of strings** (not the top-level tuple) selects
             multiple tuple/record fields.
           * **An ellipsis** (either the Python `Ellipsis` object or the
             `...` syntax) skips as many dimensions as needed to put the
             rest of the slice items to the innermost dimensions.
           * **A np.newaxis** or its equivalent, None, does not select items
             but introduces a new regular dimension in the output with size
             `1`. This is a convenient way to explicitly choose a dimension
             for broadcasting.
           * **A boolean array** with the same length as the current dimension
             (or any iterable, other than the top-level tuple) selects elements
             corresponding to each True value in the array, dropping those
             that correspond to each False. The behavior is similar to
             NumPy's
             [compress](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.compress.html)
             function.
           * **An integer array** (or any iterable, other than the top-level
             tuple) selects elements like a single integer, but produces a
             regular dimension of as many as are desired. The array can have
             any length, any order, and it can have duplicates and incomplete
             coverage. The behavior is similar to NumPy's
             [take](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.take.html)
             function.
           * **An integer Array with missing (None) items** selects multiple
             values by index, as above, but None values are passed through
             to the output. This behavior matches pyarrow's
             [Array.take](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.Array.html#pyarrow.Array.take)
             which also manages arrays with missing values. See
             <<option indexing>> below.
           * **An Array of nested lists**, ultimately containing booleans or
             integers and having the same lengths of lists at each level as
             the Array to which they're applied, selects by boolean or by
             integer at the deeply nested level. Missing items at any level
             above the deepest level must broadcast. See <<nested indexing>> below.

        A tuple of the above applies each slice item to a dimension of the
        data, which can be very expressive. More than one flat boolean/integer
        array are "iterated as one" as described in the
        [NumPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.indexing.html#integer-array-indexing).

        Filtering
        *********

        A common use of selection by boolean arrays is to filter a dataset by
        some property. For instance, to get the odd values of the `array`

            ak.Array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

        one can put an array expression with True for each odd value inside
        square brackets:

            >>> array[array % 2 == 1]
            <Array [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] type='5 * int64'>

        This technique is so common in NumPy and Pandas data analysis that it
        is often read as a syntax, rather than a consequence of array slicing.

        The extension to nested arrays like

            ak.Array([[[0, 1, 2], [], [3, 4], [5]], [[6, 7, 8], [9]]])

        allows us to use the same syntax more generally.

            >>> array[array % 2 == 1]
            <Array [[[1], [], [3], [5]], [[7], [9]]] type='2 * var * var * int64'>

        In this example, the boolean array is itself nested (see
        <<nested indexing>> below).

            >>> array % 2 == 1
            <Array [[[False, True, False], ... [True]]] type='2 * var * var * bool'>

        This also applies to data with record structures.

        For nested data, we often need to select the first or first two
        elements from variable-length lists. That can be a problem if some
        lists are empty. A function like #ak.num can be useful for first
        selecting by the lengths of lists.

            >>> array = ak.Array([[1.1, 2.2, 3.3],
            ...                   [],
            ...                   [4.4, 5.5],
            ...                   [6.6],
            ...                   [],
            ...                   [7.7, 8.8, 9.9]])
            ...
            >>> array[ak.num(array) > 0, 0]
            <Array [1.1, 4.4, 6.6, 7.7] type='4 * float64'>
            >>> array[ak.num(array) > 1, 1]
            <Array [2.2, 5.5, 8.8] type='3 * float64'>

        It's sometimes also a problem that "cleaning" the dataset by dropping
        empty lists changes its alignment, so that it can no longer be used
        in calculations with "uncleaned" data. For this, #ak.mask can be
        useful because it inserts None in positions that fail the filter,
        rather than removing them.

            >>> print(ak.mask(array, ak.num(array) > 1))
            [[1.1, 2.2, 3.3], None, [4.4, 5.5], None, None, [7.7, 8.8, 9.9]]

        Note, however, that the `0` or `1` to pick the first or second
        item of each nested list is in the second dimension, so the first
        dimension of the slice must be a `:`.

            >>> ak.mask(array, ak.num(array) > 1)[:, 0]
            <Array [1.1, None, 4.4, None, None, 7.7] type='6 * ?float64'>
            >>> ak.mask(array, ak.num(array) > 1)[:, 1]
            <Array [2.2, None, 5.5, None, None, 8.8] type='6 * ?float64'>

        Another syntax for

            ak.mask(array, array_of_booleans)

        is

            array.mask[array_of_booleans]

        (which is 5 characters away from simply filtering the `array`).

        Projection
        **********

        The following `array`

            ak.Array([[{"x": 1.1, "y": [1]}, {"x": 2.2, "y": [2, 2]}],
                      [{"x": 3.3, "y": [3, 3, 3]}],
                      [{"x": 0, "y": []}, {"x": 1.1, "y": [1, 1, 1]}]])

        has records inside of nested lists:

            >>> ak.type(array)
            3 * var * {"x": float64, "y": var * int64}

        In principle, one should select nested lists before record fields,

            >>> array[2, :, "x"]
            <Array [0, 1.1] type='2 * float64'>
            >>> array[::2, :, "x"]
            <Array [[1.1, 2.2], [0, 1.1]] type='2 * var * float64'>

        but it's also possible to select record fields first.

            >>> array["x"]
            <Array [[1.1, 2.2], [3.3], [0, 1.1]] type='3 * var * float64'>

        The string can "commute" to the left through integers and slices to
        get the same result as it would in its "natural" position.

            >>> array[2, :, "x"]
            <Array [0, 1.1] type='2 * float64'>
            >>> array[2, "x", :]
            <Array [0, 1.1] type='2 * float64'>
            >>> array["x", 2, :]
            <Array [0, 1.1] type='2 * float64'>

        The is analogous to selecting rows (integer indexes) before columns
        (string names) or columns before rows, except that the rows are
        more complex (like a Pandas
        [MultiIndex](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html)).
        This would be an expensive operation in a typical object-oriented
        environment, in which the records with fields `"x"` and `"y"` are
        akin to C structs, but for columnar Awkward Arrays, projecting
        through all records to produce an array of nested lists of `"x"`
        values just changes the metadata (no loop over data, and therefore
        fast).

        Thus, data analysts should think of records as fluid objects that
        can be easily projected apart and zipped back together with
        #ak.zip.

        Note, however, that while a column string can "commute" with row
        indexes to the left of its position in the tree, it can't commute
        to the right. For example, it's possible to use slices inside
        `"y"` because `"y"` is a list:

            >>> array[0, :, "y"]
            <Array [[1], [2, 2]] type='2 * var * int64'>
            >>> array[0, :, "y", 0]
            <Array [1, 2] type='2 * int64'>

        but it's not possible to move `"y"` to the right

            >>> array[0, :, 0, "y"]
            ValueError: in NumpyArray, too many dimensions in slice

        because the `array[0, :, 0, ...]` slice applies to both `"x"` and
        `"y"` before `"y"` is selected, and `"x"` is a one-dimensional
        NumpyArray that can't take more than its share of slices.

        Finally, note that the dot (`__getattr__`) syntax is equivalent to a single
        string in a slice (`__getitem__`) if the field name is a valid Python
        identifier and doesn't conflict with #ak.Array methods or properties.

            >>> array.x
            <Array [[1.1, 2.2], [3.3], [0, 1.1]] type='3 * var * float64'>
            >>> array.y
            <Array [[[1], [2, 2]], ... [[], [1, 1, 1]]] type='3 * var * var * int64'>

        Nested Projection
        *****************

        If records are nested within records, you can use a series of strings in
        the selector to drill down. For instance, with the following `array`,

            ak.Array([
                {"a": {"x": 1, "y": 2}, "b": {"x": 10, "y": 20}, "c": {"x": 1.1, "y": 2.2}},
                {"a": {"x": 1, "y": 2}, "b": {"x": 10, "y": 20}, "c": {"x": 1.1, "y": 2.2}},
                {"a": {"x": 1, "y": 2}, "b": {"x": 10, "y": 20}, "c": {"x": 1.1, "y": 2.2}}])

        we can go directly to the numerical data by specifying a string for the
        outer field and a string for the inner field.

            >>> array["a", "x"]
            <Array [1, 1, 1] type='3 * int64'>
            >>> array["a", "y"]
            <Array [2, 2, 2] type='3 * int64'>
            >>> array["b", "y"]
            <Array [20, 20, 20] type='3 * int64'>
            >>> array["c", "y"]
            <Array [2.2, 2.2, 2.2] type='3 * float64'>

        As with single projections, the dot (`__getattr__`) syntax is equivalent
        to a single string in a slice (`__getitem__`) if the field name is a valid
        Python identifier and doesn't conflict with #ak.Array methods or properties.

            >>> array.a.x
            <Array [1, 1, 1] type='3 * int64'>

        You can even get every field of the same name within an outer record using
        a list of field names for the outer record. The following selects the `"x"`
        field of `"a"`, `"b"`, and `"c"` records:

            >>> array[["a", "b", "c"], "x"].tolist()
            [{'a': 1, 'b': 10, 'c': 1.1},
             {'a': 1, 'b': 10, 'c': 1.1},
             {'a': 1, 'b': 10, 'c': 1.1}]

        You don't need to get all fields:

            >>> array[["a", "b"], "x"].tolist()
            [{'a': 1, 'b': 10},
             {'a': 1, 'b': 10},
             {'a': 1, 'b': 10}]

        And you can select lists of field names at all levels:

            >>> array[["a", "b"], ["x", "y"]].tolist()
            [{'a': {'x': 1, 'y': 2}, 'b': {'x': 10, 'y': 20}},
             {'a': {'x': 1, 'y': 2}, 'b': {'x': 10, 'y': 20}},
             {'a': {'x': 1, 'y': 2}, 'b': {'x': 10, 'y': 20}}]

        Option indexing
        ***************

        NumPy arrays can be sliced by all of the above slice types except
        arrays with missing values and arrays with nested lists, both of
        which are inexpressible in NumPy. Missing values, represented by
        None in Python, are called option types (#ak.types.OptionType) in
        Awkward Array and can be used as a slice.

        For example, an `array` like

            ak.Array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6, 7.7, 8.8, 9.9])

        can be sliced with a boolean array

            >>> array[[False, False, False, False, True, False, True, False, True]]
            <Array [5.5, 7.7, 9.9] type='3 * float64'>

        or a boolean array containing None values:

            >>> array[[False, False, False, False, True, None, True, None, True]]
            <Array [5.5, None, 7.7, None, 9.9] type='5 * ?float64'>

        Similarly for arrays of integers and None:

            >>> array[[0, 1, None, None, 7, 8]]
            <Array [1.1, 2.2, None, None, 8.8, 9.9] type='6 * ?float64'>

        This is the same behavior as pyarrow's
        [Array.take](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.Array.html#pyarrow.Array.take),
        which establishes a convention for how to interpret slice arrays
        with option type:

            >>> import pyarrow as pa
            >>> array = pa.array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6, 7.7, 8.8, 9.9])
            >>> array.take(pa.array([0, 1, None, None, 7, 8]))
            <pyarrow.lib.DoubleArray object at 0x7efc7f060210>
            [
              1.1,
              2.2,
              null,
              null,
              8.8,
              9.9
            ]

        Nested indexing
        ***************

        Awkward Array's nested lists can be used as slices as well, as long
        as the type at the deepest level of nesting is boolean or integer.

        For example, the `array`

            ak.Array([[[0.0, 1.1, 2.2], [], [3.3, 4.4]], [], [[5.5]]])

        can be sliced at the top level with one-dimensional arrays:

            >>> array[[False, True, True]]
            <Array [[], [[5.5]]] type='2 * var * var * float64'>
            >>> array[[1, 2]]
            <Array [[], [[5.5]]] type='2 * var * var * float64'>

        with singly nested lists:

            >>> array[[[False, True, True], [], [True]]]
            <Array [[[], [3.3, 4.4]], [], [[5.5]]] type='3 * var * var * float64'>
            >>> array[[[1, 2], [], [0]]]
            <Array [[[], [3.3, 4.4]], [], [[5.5]]] type='3 * var * var * float64'>

        and with doubly nested lists:

            >>> array[[[[False, True, False], [], [True, False]], [], [[False]]]]
            <Array [[[1.1], [], [3.3]], [], [[]]] type='3 * var * var * float64'>
            >>> array[[[[1], [], [0]], [], [[]]]]
            <Array [[[1.1], [], [3.3]], [], [[]]] type='3 * var * var * float64'>

        The key thing is that the nested slice has the same number of elements
        as the array it's slicing at every level of nesting that it reproduces.
        This is similar to the requirement that boolean arrays have the same
        length as the array they're filtering.

        This kind of slicing is useful because NumPy's
        [universal functions](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html)
        produce arrays with the same structure as the original array, which
        can then be used as filters.

            >>> print((array * 10) % 2 == 1)
            [[[False, True, False], [], [True, False]], [], [[True]]]
            >>> print(array[(array * 10) % 2 == 1])
            [[[1.1], [], [3.3]], [], [[5.5]]]

        Functions whose names start with "arg" return index positions, which
        can be used with the integer form.

            >>> print(np.argmax(array, axis=-1))
            [[2, None, 1], [], [0]]
            >>> print(array[np.argmax(array, axis=-1)])
            [[[3.3, 4.4], None, []], [], [[5.5]]]

        Here, the `np.argmax` returns the integer position of the maximum
        element or None for empty arrays. It's a nice example of
        <<option indexing>> with <<nested indexing>>.

        When applying a nested index with missing (None) entries at levels
        higher than the last level, the indexer must have the same dimension
        as the array being indexed, and the resulting output will have missing
        entries at the corresponding locations, e.g. for

            >>> print(array[ [[[0, None, 2, None, None], None, [1]], None, [[0]]] ])
            [[[0, None, 2.2, None, None], None, [4.4]], None, [[5.5]]]

        the sub-list at entry 0,0 is extended as the masked entries are
        acting at the last level, while the higher levels of the indexer all
        have the same dimension as the array being indexed.

        Unlike #__getitem__, which allows a wide variety of slice types,
        only single field-slicing is supported for assignment.
        (#ak.layout.Content arrays are immutable; field assignment replaces
        the #layout with an array that has the new field using #ak.with_field.)

        However, a field can be assigned deeply into a nested record e.g.

            >>> nested = ak.zip({"a" : ak.zip({"x" : [1, 2, 3]})})
            >>> nested["a", "y"] = 2 * nested.a.x

            [{'a': {'x': 1, 'y': 2}}, {'a': {'x': 2, 'y': 4}}, {'a': {'x': 3, 'y': 6}}]

        Note that the following does **not** work:

            >>> nested["a"]["y"] = 2 * nested.a.x # does not work, nested["a"] is a copy!

        Always assign by passing the whole path to the top level

            >>> nested["a", "y"] = 2 * nested.a.x

        If necessary, the new field will be broadcasted to fit the array.
        For example, given an `array` like

            ak.Array([[{"x": 1.1}, {"x": 2.2}, {"x": 3.3}], [], [{"x": 4.4}, {"x": 5.5}]])

        which has three elements with nested data in each, assigning

            >>> array["y"] = [100, 200, 300]

        will result in

            >>> ak.to_list(array)
            [[{'x': 1.1, 'y': 100}, {'x': 2.2, 'y': 100}, {'x': 3.3, 'y': 100}],
             [],
             [{'x': 4.4, 'y': 300}, {'x': 5.5, 'y': 300}]]

        because the `100` in `what[0]` is broadcasted to all three nested
        elements of `array[0]`, the `200` in `what[1]` is broadcasted to the
        empty list `array[1]`, and the `300` in `what[2]` is broadcasted to
        both elements of `array[2]`.

        This method conforms to NumPy's
        [NEP 13](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0013-ufunc-overrides.html)
        for overriding ufuncs, which has been

        (and thus NumPy 1.13 is the minimum allowed version).

        When any ufunc is applied to an Awkward Array, it applies to the
        innermost level of structure and preserves the structure through the
        operation.

        For example, with an `array` like

            ak.Array([[{"x": 0.0, "y": []}, {"x": 1.1, "y": [1]}], [], [{"x": 2.2, "y": [2, 2]}]])

        applying `np.sqrt` would yield

            >>> print(np.sqrt(array))
            [[{x: 0, y: []}, {x: 1.05, y: [1]}], [], [{x: 1.48, y: [1.41, 1.41]}]]

        In addition, many unary and binary operators implicitly call ufuncs,
        such as `np.power` in

            >>> print(array**2)
            [[{x: 0, y: []}, {x: 1.21, y: [1]}], [], [{x: 4.84, y: [4, 4]}]]

        In the above example, `array` is a nested list of records and `2` is
        a scalar. Awkward Array applies the same broadcasting rules as NumPy
        plus a few more to deal with nested structures. In addition to
        broadcasting a scalar, as above, it is possible to broadcast
        arrays with less depth into arrays with more depth, such as

            >>> print(array + ak.Array([10, 20, 30]))
            [[{x: 10, y: []}, {x: 11.1, y: [11]}], [], [{x: 32.2, y: [32, 32]}]]

        See #ak.broadcast_arrays for details about broadcasting and the
        generalized set of broadcasting rules.

        Third party libraries can create ufuncs, not just NumPy, so any library
        that "plays well" with the NumPy ecosystem can be used with Awkward
        Arrays:

            >>> import numba as nb
            >>> @nb.vectorize([nb.float64(nb.float64)])
            ... def sqr(x):

    General tool for building arrays of nested data structures from a sequence

        ##########################################################################################

       * #record: context manager for #begin_record and #end_record.

    ArrayBuilders can be used in [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/): they can
    be passed as arguments to a Numba-compiled function or returned as return
    values. (Since ArrayBuilder works by accumulating side-effects, it's not
    strictly necessary to return the object.)

    The primary limitation is that ArrayBuilders cannot be *created* and
    #snapshot cannot be called inside the Numba-compiled function. Awkward
    Array uses Numba as a transformer: #ak.Array and an empty #ak.ArrayBuilder
    go in and a filled #ak.ArrayBuilder is the result; #snapshot can be called
    outside of the compiled function.

    Also, context managers (Python's `with` statement) are not supported in
    Numba yet, so the #list, #tuple, and #record methods are not available
    in Numba-compiled functions.

    Here is an example of filling an ArrayBuilder in Numba, which makes a
    tree of dynamic depth.
